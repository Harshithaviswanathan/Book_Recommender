This project presents a hybrid book recommender system combining collaborative filtering with K-Means clustering and content-based filtering using KNN for 
personalized suggestions. Machine learning models like SVM, Logistic Regression, and KMeans determine whether a user likes a particular book. A Naive Bayes sentiment analysis 
of reviews further refines recommendations. Additionally, a chatbot function enhances user interaction. Built with Streamlit, the system offers an intuitive interface for
exploring recommendations, top-rated books, and personalized insights
